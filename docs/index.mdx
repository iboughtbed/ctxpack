`ctxpack` is a CLI that helps you give AI tools reliable context from your projects.

It lets you:

- add local folders or git repositories as resources
- sync and index them
- search with hybrid, text, or vector strategies
- run quick answers, tool-based exploration, or deep research

## Install

```bash
bun i -g ctxpack@latest
```

## First Run

```bash
ctxpack          # shows setup status
ctxpack setup    # creates ./ctxpack.config.jsonc if missing
ctxpack connect  # connects to an LLM provider
ctxpack skill    # installs the agent skill
ctxpack serve    # starts the local server
```

## Next Step

Follow the [Quickstart](/quickstart) to add a resource and run your first `ctxpack ask`.
